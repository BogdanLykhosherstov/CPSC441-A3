INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Compile
2) Enter the name of the map, then the address book with the full file extension(e.g canadahomes.txt)
3) Then select from 1 of the 4 options of routing algorithms to run
4) Type -1 to exit the program

OBSERVATION:

The algorithm itself runs in O(n^2) time regardless of the routing, however the parsing tasks increase the complexity further. 
On relatively small topology files the performance difference will be negligible, such as the test and the full map given in this assignment.
However it is apparent that with increasing size and length of the topology file, the runtime will exponentially increase.
